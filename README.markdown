# HTML5 History in CoffeeScript #

I took @sydlawrence's [example](https://github.com/philnash/HTML5-History/blob/coffeescript/history.js) and rewrote it in [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/philnash/HTML5-History/blob/coffeescript/coffee/history.coffee) as a way to start learning CoffeeScript as well as the HTML5 history API.

Once [recompiled](https://github.com/philnash/HTML5-History/blob/coffeescript/coffee/history.js) the example page worked successfully as before.
